# BrainTumour_Detection
A project that detects brain Tumors using layered Deep Learning Pipeline to perform Classification and Segmentation. Deep learning has been proven to be superior in detecting diseases from X-rays, MRI scans which could significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. We have 3929 Brain scans along with their tumour location. 

# Approach
- Goal of image segmentation is to understand and extract information from images at the pixel level. 
- Image Segmentation can be used for object recognition and localization which offers tremendous value in many applications such as medical imaging and self driving cars. 
- The goal is to train a Neural Network to produce pixel-wise mask of the image.
- Mordern image segmentation techniques are based on deep learning approach which makes use of common architectures such as CNN, FCN.
- We will use ResUNet architecture to solve the task.

Read data from data_mask.csv into brain_df

### Mask
- Goal of image segmentation is to understand image at pixel level. It associates each pixel with a certain class. The output produced by image segmentation model is called "mask" of the image.
- Masks can represented by pixel coordinates, we have flattened the array into 1-D array, we use the index to create the mask.

```
brain_df.mask_path[1] # Path to the brain MRI image
brain_df.image_path[1] # Path to the segmentation mask
```

## Task 3. Perform Data Visualization
The mask distribution between all images is as follows,

We use the image path to visualise the tumour using gray scale:

Now we divide the images into 2 categories Brain MRI and Mask, see them in a grid layout
